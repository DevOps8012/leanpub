## Smoothing 

Smoothing is a very powerful technique used all across data analsysis. The general idea is to group data points that are expected to have similar expectations and 

The following data are from measurements from replicated RNA. We consider that data used in an the MA-plot ( {$$}Y$=log ratios and {/$$}A$=averages) and take down-sample in a way that balances the number of points for different strata of {$$}A{/$$}:


```r
library(Biobase)
library(SpikeIn)
```

```
## Error in library(SpikeIn): there is no package called 'SpikeIn'
```

```r
data(SpikeIn95)
```

```
## Warning in data(SpikeIn95): data set 'SpikeIn95' not found
```

```r
##Example with two columns
i=10;j=9
##remove the spiked in genes and take random sample
siNames<-colnames(pData(SpikeIn95))
```

```
## Error in colnames(pData(SpikeIn95)): error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'colnames': Error in pData(SpikeIn95) : 
##   error in evaluating the argument 'object' in selecting a method for function 'pData': Error: object 'SpikeIn95' not found
```

```r
ind <- which(!probeNames(SpikeIn95)%in%siNames)
```

```
## Error in match(x, table, nomatch = 0L): could not find function "probeNames"
```

```r
pms <- pm(SpikeIn95)[ ind ,c(i,j)]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "pm"
```

```r
##pick a representative sample for A and order A
Y=log2(pms[,1])-log2(pms[,2])
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pms' not found
```

```r
X=(log2(pms[,1])+log2(pms[,2]))/2
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pms' not found
```

```r
set.seed(4)
ind <- tapply(seq(along=X),round(X*5),function(i)
  if(length(i)>20) return(sample(i,20)) else return(NULL))
```

```
## Error in tapply(seq(along = X), round(X * 5), function(i) if (length(i) > : error in evaluating the argument 'X' in selecting a method for function 'tapply': Error in seq(along = X) : object 'X' not found
```

```r
ind <- unlist(ind)
```

```
## Error in unlist(ind): error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'unlist': Error: object 'ind' not found
```

```r
X <- X[ind]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```r
Y <- Y[ind]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found
```

```r
o <-order(X)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```r
X <- X[o]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```r
Y <- Y[o]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found
```

In the MA plot we see that there {$$}Y{/$$} depends on {$$}X{/$$}. Note that this this dependence must be a bias because these are based on replicates which means {$$}Y{/$$} should be 0 on average regardless of {$$}X{/$$}. We want to predict {$$}f(x)=E(Y \mid X=x){/$$} so that we can remove this bias.


```r
library(rafalib)
mypar2(1,1)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```r
plot(X,Y)
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y): object 'X' not found
```

Note that linear regression is biased does not capture the apparent curvature in {$$}f(x){/$$}:


```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y): object 'X' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found
```

```
## Error in points(X, Y, pch = 21, bg = ifelse(Y > fit$fitted, 1, 3)): object 'X' not found
```

```
## Error in abline(fit, col = 2, lwd = 4, lty = 2): object 'fit' not found
```
Note for example that points above the fitted line (green) and those below (purple) are not evenly distributed.

## Bin Smoothing

Instead of fitting a line, let's go back to the idea of stratifying and computing the mean. This is referred to as _bin smoothing_. Now, if we stratify by {$$}x{/$$} The general idea is that the underlying curve is "smooth" enough that in small bins it is approximately constant which implies all the {$$}Y{/$$} in that bin have the same expected value. For example, in the plot below we highlight points in a bin centered at 8.6 as well as the points of a bin centered at 12.1 if we us bins of size 1. We also show  and the fitted mean values for the {$$}Y{/$$} in those bin (dashed lines):


```r
mypar2(1,1)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```r
centers <- seq(min(X),max(X),0.1)
```

```
## Error in seq(min(X), max(X), 0.1): object 'X' not found
```

```r
plot(X,Y,col="grey",pch=16)
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y, col = "grey", pch = 16): object 'X' not found
```

```r
windowSize <- .5
i <- 25
center<-centers[i]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'centers' not found
```

```r
ind=which(X>center-windowSize & X<center+windowSize)
```

```
## Error in which(X > center - windowSize & X < center + windowSize): object 'X' not found
```

```r
fit<-mean(Y)
```

```
## Error in mean(Y): object 'Y' not found
```

```r
points(X[ind],Y[ind],bg=3,pch=21)
```

```
## Error in points(X[ind], Y[ind], bg = 3, pch = 21): object 'X' not found
```

```r
lines(c(min(X[ind]),max(X[ind])),c(fit,fit),col=2,lty=2,lwd=4)
```

```
## Error in lines(c(min(X[ind]), max(X[ind])), c(fit, fit), col = 2, lty = 2, : object 'X' not found
```

```r
i <- 60
center<-centers[i]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'centers' not found
```

```r
ind=which(X>center-windowSize & X<center+windowSize)
```

```
## Error in which(X > center - windowSize & X < center + windowSize): object 'X' not found
```

```r
fit<-mean(Y[ind])
```

```
## Error in mean(Y[ind]): object 'Y' not found
```

```r
points(X[ind],Y[ind],bg=3,pch=21)
```

```
## Error in points(X[ind], Y[ind], bg = 3, pch = 21): object 'X' not found
```

```r
lines(c(min(X[ind]),max(X[ind])),c(fit,fit),col=2,lty=2,lwd=4)
```

```
## Error in lines(c(min(X[ind]), max(X[ind])), c(fit, fit), col = 2, lty = 2, : object 'X' not found
```

By computing this mean for bins around every point we form an estimate of the underlying curve {$$}f(x){/$$}:

```r
windowSize<-0.5
smooth<-rep(NA,length(centers))
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'centers' not found
```

```r
mypar2(4,3)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```r
for(i in seq(along=centers)){
  center<-centers[i]
  ind=which(X>center-windowSize & X<center+windowSize)
  smooth[i]<-mean(Y[ind])
  if(i%%round(length(centers)/12)==1){ ##we show 12
    plot(X,Y,col="grey",pch=16)
    points(X[ind],Y[ind],bg=3,pch=21)
    lines(c(min(X[ind]),max(X[ind])),c(smooth[i],smooth[i]),col=2,lwd=2)
    lines(centers[1:i],smooth[1:i],col="black")
    points(centers[i],smooth[i],col="black",pch=16,cex=1.5)
  }
}
```

```
## Error in seq(along = centers): object 'centers' not found
```

The final result looks like this:


```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y, col = "darkgrey", pch = 16): object 'X' not found
```

```
## Error in lines(centers, smooth, col = "black", lwd = 3): object 'centers' not found
```


##Loess
 
Local weighted regression (loess) is similar to bin smoothing. The difference is that we approximate the local behavior with a line or a parabola. This permits us to expand the bin sizes as seen below:


```r
centers <- seq(min(X),max(X),0.1)
```

```
## Error in seq(min(X), max(X), 0.1): object 'X' not found
```

```r
mypar2(1,1)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```r
plot(X,Y,col="darkgrey",pch=16)
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y, col = "darkgrey", pch = 16): object 'X' not found
```

```r
windowSize <- 1.25
i <- 25
center<-centers[i]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'centers' not found
```

```r
ind=which(X>center-windowSize & X<center+windowSize)
```

```
## Error in which(X > center - windowSize & X < center + windowSize): object 'X' not found
```

```r
fit<-lm(Y~X,subset=ind)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found
```

```r
points(X[ind],Y[ind],bg=3,pch=21)
```

```
## Error in points(X[ind], Y[ind], bg = 3, pch = 21): object 'X' not found
```

```r
a <- min(X[ind]);b <- max(X[ind])
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```r
lines(c(a,b),fit$coef[1]+fit$coef[2]*c(a,b),col=2,lty=2,lwd=3)
```

```
## Error in lines(c(a, b), fit$coef[1] + fit$coef[2] * c(a, b), col = 2, : object 'a' not found
```

```r
i <- 60
center<-centers[i]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'centers' not found
```

```r
ind=which(X>center-windowSize & X<center+windowSize)
```

```
## Error in which(X > center - windowSize & X < center + windowSize): object 'X' not found
```

```r
fit<-lm(Y~X,subset=ind)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found
```

```r
points(X[ind],Y[ind],bg=3,pch=21)
```

```
## Error in points(X[ind], Y[ind], bg = 3, pch = 21): object 'X' not found
```

```r
a <- min(X[ind]);b <- max(X[ind])
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X' not found
```

```r
lines(c(a,b),fit$coef[1]+fit$coef[2]*c(a,b),col=2,lty=2,lwd=3)
```

```
## Error in lines(c(a, b), fit$coef[1] + fit$coef[2] * c(a, b), col = 2, : object 'a' not found
```

Here are 12 steps of the process:

```r
mypar2(4,3)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```r
windowSize<-1.25
smooth<-rep(NA,length(centers))
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'centers' not found
```

```r
for(i in seq(along=centers)){
  center<-centers[i]
  ind=which(X>center-windowSize & X<center+windowSize)
  fit<-lm(Y~X,subset=ind)
  smooth[i]<-fit$coef[1]+fit$coef[2]*center

  if(i%%round(length(centers)/12)==1){ ##we show 12
    plot(X,Y,col="grey",pch=16)
    points(X[ind],Y[ind],bg=3,pch=21)
    a <- min(X[ind]);b <- max(X[ind])
    lines(c(a,b),fit$coef[1]+fit$coef[2]*c(a,b),col=2,lwd=2)
  
    lines(centers[1:i],smooth[1:i],col="black")
    points(centers[i],smooth[i],col="black",pch=16,cex=1.5)
  }
}
```

```
## Error in seq(along = centers): object 'centers' not found
```

This results is a smoother fit since we use larger sample sizes to estimate our local parameters:


```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y, col = "darkgrey", pch = 16): object 'X' not found
```

```
## Error in lines(centers, smooth, col = "black", lwd = 3): object 'centers' not found
```

The that function `loess` performs this analysis for us:


```r
fit <- loess(Y~X, degree=1, span=1/3)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Y' not found
```

```r
newx <- seq(min(X),max(X),len=100) 
```

```
## Error in seq(min(X), max(X), len = 100): object 'X' not found
```

```r
smooth <- predict(fit,newdata=data.frame(X=newx))
```

```
## Error in predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(X = newx)): object 'fit' not found
```

```r
mypar2(1,1)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "mypar2"
```

```r
plot(X,Y,col="darkgrey",pch=16)
```

```
## Error in plot(X, Y, col = "darkgrey", pch = 16): object 'X' not found
```

```r
lines(newx,smooth,col="black",lwd=3)
```

```
## Error in lines(newx, smooth, col = "black", lwd = 3): object 'newx' not found
```
