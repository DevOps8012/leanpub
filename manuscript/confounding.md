## Confounding

R markdown document for this section available from [https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/confounding.Rmd](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/confounding.Rmd)

Batch effects have the most devasting effects when they are _counfounded_ with outcomes of interest. Here we described coufounding generally and how it relates to data interpretation.

"Correlation is not causation" is one of the most important lessons you should take from this or any other data analysis course. A common example for why this statement is so often true is confounding. Simply stated confounding occurs when we observe a correlation or association between {$$}X{/$$} and {$$}Y{/$$}, but  this is strictly the result of both {$$}X{/$$} and {$$}Y{/$$} depending on an extraneous variable {$$}Z{/$$}. Here we describe Simpson's paradox, perhaps the most famous case of confounding, and then show an example of confounding in high throughput biology.

### Simpson's Paradox

Admission data from U.C. Berkeley 1973 showed that more men were being admitted than women: 44% men admitted compared to 30% women. This actually led to a [lawsuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#Berkeley_gender_bias_case). See: PJ Bickel, EA Hammel, and JW O'Connell. Science (1975)



```r
library(dagdata)
data(admissions)
admissions$total=admissions$Percent*admissions$Number/100
##percent men get in
sum(admissions$total[admissions$Gender==1]/sum(admissions$Number[admissions$Gender==1]))
```

```
## [1] 0.4451951
```

```r
##percent women get in
sum(admissions$total[admissions$Gender==0]/sum(admissions$Number[admissions$Gender==0]))
```

```
## [1] 0.3033351
```

A chi-square test clearly rejects the hypothesis that gender and admission are independent:

```r
##let's make a 2 x 2
index = admissions$Gender==1
men = admissions[index,]
women = admissions[!index,]
menYes = sum(men$Number*men$Percent/100)
menNo = sum(men$Number*(1-men$Percent/100))
womenYes = sum(women$Number*women$Percent/100)
womenNo = sum(women$Number*(1-women$Percent/100))
tab = matrix(c(menYes,womenYes,menNo,womenNo),2,2)
print(chisq.test(tab)$p.val)
```

```
## [1] 9.139492e-22
```

But closer inspection shows a paradoxical result. Here are the percent admissions by Major:

```r
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,c(1,3)],admissions[7:12,3])
colnames(y)[2:3]=c("Male","Female")
y
```

```
##   Major Male Female
## 1     A   62     82
## 2     B   63     68
## 3     C   37     34
## 4     D   33     35
## 5     E   28     24
## 6     F    6      7
```


Here are the absolute numbers of admissions by major:

```r
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,c(1,2)],admissions[7:12,2])
colnames(y)[2:3]=c("Male","Female")
y
```

```
##   Major Male Female
## 1     A  825    108
## 2     B  560     25
## 3     C  325    593
## 4     D  417    375
## 5     E  191    393
## 6     F  373    341
```

The chi-square test we performed above suggests a dependence between admission and gender.  Yet when the data is grouped by Major, this dependence doesn't seem borne out.  What's going on? 

This is called _Simpson's paradox_ .
As we will see, males were much more likely to apply to "easy" majors. 

Male and "easy"" majors are confounded. 

```r
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,5],admissions[7:12,5])
y=sweep(y,2,colSums(y),"/")*100
x=rowMeans(cbind(admissions[1:6,3],admissions[7:12,3]))

library(rafalib)
mypar()
matplot(x,y,xlab="percent that gets in the major",ylab="percent that applies to major",col=c("blue","red"),cex=1.5)
legend("topleft",c("Male","Female"),col=c("blue","red"),pch=c("1","2"),box.lty=0)
```

### Confounding Explained Graphically


In the plots below each letter represents a person. Accepted individuals are denoted in green and not admitted in orange. The letter indicates the major. In this plot we group all the students together and notice that the proportion of green is larger for men.


![Admitted are in green and majors are denoted with letters. Here we clearly see that more males get admitted.](images/R/confounding-tmp-simpsons_paradox_illustration-1.png) 

Now we stratify the data by major. The key point here is that most of the men denoted with green come from majors A and B, which are the ones with the highest acceptance rate. 


![Simpon's Paradox illustrated. Admitted students are in green. Students are now stratified by the major they applied to.](images/R/confounding-tmp-simpsons_paradox_illustration2-1.png) 

### Average After Stratifying

So if we condition or stratify by major this goes away. 

```r
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,3],admissions[7:12,3])
matplot(1:6,y,xaxt="n",xlab="major",ylab="percent",col=c("blue","red"),cex=1.5)
legend("topright",c("Male","Female"),col=c("blue","red"),pch=c("1","2"),box.lty=0,cex=0.75)
```

![Admission percentage by major for each gender.](images/R/confounding-tmp-admission_by_major-1.png) 

The average difference by Major is 3.5% higher for women.


```r
mean(y[,1]-y[,2])
```

```
## [1] -3.5
```

### Simpson's Paradox In Baseball

Simpson's Paradox is commonly seen in baseball statistics. Here is a well known example in which David Justice had a higher batting average that Derek Jeter in both 1995 and 1996, but Jeter had a higher overall average:

|               | 1995           | 1996           | Combined        |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Derek Jeter   | 12/48 (.250)   | 183/582 (.314) | 195/630 (.310)  |
| David Justice | 104/411 (.253) | 45/140 (.321)  | 149/551 (.270)  |

## Confounding: High-throughput Example

R markdown document for this section available from [https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/confounding.Rmd](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/confounding.Rmd)

To describe the problem of confoudning with a real example we will use a dataset from a paper [CITE] that claimed that roughly 50% of genes where differentially expressed when comparing blood from two ethnic groups. We include the data in one of our data packages:


```r
##Following two libraries are available from Bioconductor
library(Biobase) ##install from Bioconductor
library(genefilter) 
###Following library is available from course repository
library(GSE5859) 
data(GSE5859)
```

We can extract the gene expression data and sample information table using the Bioconductor functions `exprs` and `pData` like this:


```r
geneExpression = exprs(e)
sampleInfo = pData(e)
```

Note that some samples were processed at different times.


```r
head(sampleInfo$date)
```

```
## [1] "2003-02-04" "2003-02-04" "2002-12-17" "2003-01-30" "2003-01-03"
## [6] "2003-01-16"
```

This is an extraneous variable and should not affect the values in `geneExpression`. However, as we have seen in previous analyses, it does appear to have an effect.  As a result, we will explore this here.

We can immediately see that year and ethnicity are almost completely confounded:


```r
year = factor( format(sampleInfo$date,"%y") )
tab = table(year,sampleInfo$ethnicity)
print(tab)
```

```
##     
## year ASN CEU HAN
##   02   0  32   0
##   03   0  54   0
##   04   0  13   0
##   05  80   3   0
##   06   2   0  24
```

By running a t-test and creating a volcano plot, we note that thousands of genes appear to be differentially expressed. Yet when we perform a similar comparison only on the CEU population between the years 2002 and 2003, we again obtain thousands of diferentially expressed genes:



```r
library(genefilter)

##remove control genes
out <- grep("AFFX",rownames(geneExpression))

eth <- sampleInfo$ethnicity
ind<- which(eth%in%c("CEU","ASN"))
res1 <- rowttests(geneExpression[-out,ind],droplevels(eth[ind]))
ind <- which(year%in%c("02","03") & eth=="CEU")
res2 <- rowttests(geneExpression[-out,ind],droplevels(year[ind]))

XLIM <- max(abs(c(res1$dm,res2$dm)))*c(-1,1)
YLIM <- range(-log10(c(res1$p,res2$p)))
mypar(1,2)
plot(res1$dm,-log10(res1$p),xlim=XLIM,ylim=YLIM,xlab="Effect size",ylab="-log10(p-value)",main="Populations")
plot(res2$dm,-log10(res2$p),xlim=XLIM,ylim=YLIM,xlab="Effect size",ylab="-log10(p-value)",main="2003 v 2002")
```
