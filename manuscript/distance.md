# Distance and Dimension Reduction

## Introduction

R markdown document for this section available [here](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/distance.Rmd).

Many of the analyses we perform with high-dimensional data relate directly or indirectly to distance. For instance, many clustering and machine learning techniques rely on being able to define distance using features or predictors. The concept of distance can be generalized from physical distance; for example, we cluster animals into groups. When we do this, we put animals that are "close" in the same group:

Any time we cluster individuals into separate groups we are, explicitly or implicitly, computing a distance. To create _heatmaps_ a distance is computed explicitly. Heatmaps are widely used in genomics and other highthroughput fields:

In these plots the measurements, which are stored in a matrix, are
represented with colors after the columns and rows have been
clustered. (A side note: red and green, a common color theme for heatmaps,
are two of the most difficult colors for many people who are
color-blind to discern, better to use yellow and blue/purple.)
Here we will learn the necessary mathematics and computing
skills to understand and create heatmaps. We start by reviewing the
mathematical definition of distance.

## Euclidean Distance

R markdown document for this section available [here](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/distance.Rmd).

As a review, let's define the distance between two points, {$$}A{/$$} and {$$}B{/$$}, on a Cartesian plane.

The euclidean distance between {$$}A{/$$} and {$$}B{/$$} is simply:

{$$}\sqrt{ (A_x-B_x)^2 + (A_y-B_y)^2}{/$$}


## Distance in High Dimensions

R markdown document for this section available [here](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/tree/master/course3/distance.Rmd).

We introduce a dataset with gene expression measurements for 22,215 genes from 189 samples. The R objects can be downloaded like this:


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("genomicsclass/tissuesGeneExpression")
```

The data represent RNA expression levels for eight tissues, each with several individuals.


```r
library(tissuesGeneExpression)
data(tissuesGeneExpression)
dim(e) ##e contains the expression data
```

```
## [1] 22215   189
```

```r
table(tissue) ##tissue[i] tells us what tissue is represented by e[,i]
```

```
## tissue
##  cerebellum       colon endometrium hippocampus      kidney       liver 
##          38          34          15          31          39          26 
##    placenta 
##           6
```

We are interested in describing distance between samples in the context of this dataset. We might also be interested in finding genes that _behave similarly_ across samples.

To define distance we need to know what the points are since mathematical distance is computed between points. With high dimensional data, points are no longer on the Cartesian plan. Instead they are in higher dimensions. For example, sample {$$}i{/$$} is defined by a point in 22,215 dimensional space: {$$}(Y_{1,i},\dots,Y_{22215,i})^\top{/$$}. Feature {$$}g{/$$} is defined by a point in 189 dimensions {$$}(Y_{g,189},\dots,Y_{g,189})^\top{/$$}

Once we define points, the Euclidean distance is defined in a very similar way as it is defined for two dimensions. For instance, the distance between two samples {$$}i{/$$} and {$$}j{/$$} is:

{$$}
\mbox{dist}(i,j) = \sqrt{ \sum_{g=1}^{22215} (Y_{g,i}-Y_{g,j })^2 }
{/$$}

and the distance between two features {$$}h{/$$} and {$$}g{/$$} as:

{$$}
\mbox{dist}(h,g) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{189} (Y_{h,i}-Y_{g,i})^2 }
{/$$}


### Distance with Matrix Algebra

The distance between samples {$$}i{/$$} and {$$}j{/$$} can be written as

{$$} \mbox{dist}(i,j) = (\mathbf{Y}_i - \mathbf{Y}_j)^\top(\mathbf{Y}_i - \mathbf{Y}_j){/$$}

With {$$}\mathbf{Y}_i{/$$} and {$$}\mathbf{Y}_j{/$$} columns {$$}i{/$$} and {$$}j{/$$}. This result can be very convenient in practice as computations can be made much faster using matrix multiplication.

### Examples

We can now use the formulas above to compute distance. Let's compute distance between samples 1 and 2, both kidneys, and then to 87, a colon.


```r
x <- e[,1]
y <- e[,2]
z <- e[,87]
sqrt(sum((x-y)^2))
```

```
## [1] 85.8546
```

```r
sqrt(sum((x-z)^2))
```

```
## [1] 122.8919
```

As expected the kidneys are closer to each other. A faster way to compute this is using matrix algebra:


```r
sqrt( crossprod(x-y) )
```

```
##         [,1]
## [1,] 85.8546
```

```r
sqrt( crossprod(x-z) )
```

```
##          [,1]
## [1,] 122.8919
```

Now to compute all the distances at once, we have the function `dist`. Because it computes the distance between each row, and here we are interested in the distance between samples, we transpose the matrix


```r
d <- dist(t(e))
class(d)
```

```
## [1] "dist"
```

Note that this produces an object of class `dist` and to access the entries we need to coerce it into a matrix:


```r
as.matrix(d)[1,2]
```

```
## [1] 85.8546
```

```r
as.matrix(d)[1,87]
```

```
## [1] 122.8919
```

It is important to remember that if we run `dist` on `e`, it will compute all pairwise distances between genes. This will try to create a {$$}22215 \times 22215{/$$} matrix that may crash your R sessions.
